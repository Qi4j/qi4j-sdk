Description of TransientComposite tutorials.

<h2>TransientComposite tutorials</h2>
<p>
Throughout this set of tutorials it will be shown how to create and work with TransientComposites, which
is the basic element in Qi4j. We will refactor one HelloWorld class to take advantage of the various
features in Qi4j. These refactorings will make it easier to reuse parts of the class,
and introduce new features without having to change existing code. We will also look
at some of the existing classes, or Fragments, available in Qi4j that you can reuse
so that you don't have to write everything yourself.
</p>
<p>
Each tutorial in this series starts with the result from the previous tutorial, so you can
always look at the next tutorial step for guidance on what to do. Here are the steps:
