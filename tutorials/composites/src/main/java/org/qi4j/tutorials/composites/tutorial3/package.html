<h1>Tutorial 3 - Mixins</h1>
<p>
In this tutorial we refactor the Mixin from the previous steps into two, one which serves
the behaviour interface and one which serves the state interface. This makes it possible to
reuse the interfaces independently and also makes it easier to exchange one interface implementation
with another. This also allows us to specify the new Mixins as default implementations of
the interfaces by adding @Mixins annotations on them.
</p>
<p>
Steps for this tutorial:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Refactor the Mixin into one which implement the behaviour interface and one which implements the state
        interface. Use the @This injection annotation to allow the behaviour to access the state.
    </li>
    <li>Add a @Mixins annotations on the behaviour and state interfaces which declare the Mixins as default
        implementations.
    </li>
    <li>Remove the @Mixins annotation from the TransientComposite interface.</li>
</ol>
