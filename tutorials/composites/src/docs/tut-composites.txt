= Transient Composites Tutorial =

TIP: Theses tutorials are based on actual code found in the `tutorials/` directory of the
http://qi4j.org/downloads.html[Qi4j SDK sources]. You should start your favorite editor and find the code related to
this tutorial, run it and play with it.

Throughout this set of tutorials it will be shown how to create and work with Composites, which
is the basic element in Qi4j. We will refactor one HelloWorld class to take advantage of the various
features in Qi4j. These refactorings will make it easier to reuse parts of the class,
and introduce new features without having to change existing code. We will also look
at some of the existing classes, or Fragments, available in Qi4j that you can reuse
so that you don't have to write everything yourself.
