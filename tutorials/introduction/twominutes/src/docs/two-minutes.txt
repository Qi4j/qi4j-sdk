= Qi4j in 2 minutes =

TIP: Theses tutorials are based on actual code found in the `tutorials/` directory of the
https://qi4j.github.com/download.html[Qi4j SDK sources]. You should start your favorite editor and find the code related to
this tutorial, run it and play with it.

To show that Qi4j is not necessarily complex, not hard to get going with and easy to deploy, we are first showing the
classic HelloWorld, as small as it can get and still be Composite Oriented Programming and not only standard OOP.

If you want to reproduce what's explained in this tutorial, remember to depend on the Core Runtime artifact that depends
on Core API, Core SPI, and Core Bootstrap:

include::../../../../../core/runtime/build/docs/buildinfo/artifact.txt[]

See the <<howto-depend-on-qi4j>> tutorial for details.

Ready, Set, Go!

Let's say we want to do the common HelloWorld example, but with a more domain-oriented setting.
We have a Speaker interface that does the talking.
But we also need an implementation for Speaker, which we declare here via the `@Mixins( SpeakerMixin.class )`.

And of course, the simple implementation of the Speaker interface.
In this case, return a String with the content "Hello, World!".

So far so good. We now need to make this into something that can run. This can be done like this;

. The SingletonAssembler is a convenience class that creates a Qi4j Runtime instance and an application with one layer
  and one module in it.

. We declare a TransientComposite of type `Speaker`.

. We create the Composite instance from the Module.

*Done!*
