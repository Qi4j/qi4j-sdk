    <h1>Step 2 - Hooking into the Service Activation</h1>

    <p>
        Services can be "<i>activated</i>" and "<i>passivated</i>". Applications can be notified of this occurring
        by Qi4j runtime by assembling them with an <code>Activator</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Activators methods are called around "<i>activation</i>" and "<i>passivation</i>": <code>beforeActivation</code>,
        <code>afterActivation</code>, <code>beforeActivation</code>, <code>afterPassivation</code>. The
        <code>ActivatorAdapter</code> class help you keeping your code short when you only need one or two hooks.
    </p>
    <p>
        To showcase how this works, we refactor the code to create a number of copies of the books, to be lend out
        upon call to the <code>borrowBook</code> method, which will return null if no copy is available. The book
        copies are created in the <code>activate</code> method.
    </p>

    <p>Steps to do.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add a <code>createInitialData</code> method to <code>Library</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the implementation, create a couple of books of each title and store each copy in a
            <code>HashMap&lt;String,ArrayList&lt;Book&gt;&gt;</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Write an <code>Activator&lt;ServiceReference&lt;Library&gt;&gt;</code> class extending
            <code>ActivatorAdapter</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Override the <code>afterActivation</code> method, use the <code>ServiceReference</code> to get a
            handle on the <code>Library</code> and call its <code>createInitialData</code> method.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the <code>@Activators</code> annotation to the <code>LibraryService</code> declaring the new
            <code>LibraryActivator</code>.
        </li>
    </ol>

</body>
