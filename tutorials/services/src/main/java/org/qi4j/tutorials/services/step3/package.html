    <h1>Step 3 - Reading the Service Configuration</h1>

    <p>
        Services typically have configuration. Configurations are directly supported in Qi4j. A
        <code>ConfigurationComposite</code> is a subtype of <code>EntityComposite</code>. That is because
        configurations are stored in EntityStores, can be modified in runtime by client code and has
        the same semantics as regular entities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Qi4j also handles the bootstrapping of configuration for the services. If the ConfigurationComposite is
        not found in the configured entity store, then Qi4j will automatically locate a properties file for each
        service instance, read those properties into a ConfigurationComposite instance, save that to the
        entity store and provide the values to the service. The properties file must be with the same name as
        the service instance with the extension <code>"properties"</code> in the same package as the service.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this exercise, create a <code>LibraryConfiguration</code> that contains "titles", "authors" and "copies".
        The first two are a string with a comma separated list, and the "copies" is just an Integer with how many
        copies are made of each title.
    </p>

    <p>Steps to do.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a <code>LibraryConfiguration</code> interface that extends <code>ConfigurationComposite</code>,
            and has three <code>Property</code> instances named <code>"titles"</code>, <code>"authors"</code> and
            <code>"copies"</code>, where the first two are of <code>String</code> type and the last is of
            <code>Integer</code> type.
        </li>
        <li>Delete the <code>LibraryActivator</code> and remove the <code>@Activators</code> annotation from the
            <code>LibraryService</code> and the corresponding <code>createInitialData</code> method.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the <code>LibraryMixin</code> remove the member injection of the <code>ValueBuilderFactory</code>, and
            instead inject the <code>ValueBuilderFactory</code> in the constructor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Inject the <code>LibraryConfiguration</code> via the constructor. The injection scope is <code>@This</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a resource called <code>LibraryService.properties</code> and place it in the directory
            <code>org/qi4j/tutorials/services/step4</code> in the classpath (for instance, <code>src/main/resources</code>
            ).
            Put something like;
            <span class="javaxcode"><pre>titles=Domain Driven Design, Pragmatic Programmer, Extreme Programming Explained
authors=Eric Evans, Andy Hunt, Kent Beck

#Number of copies of each book.
copies=3
                </pre>
            </span>
            in this file.
        </li>
        <li>
            Load initial data from the <code>LibraryConfiguration</code> in the <code>LibraryMixin</code> constructor.
        </li>
    </ol>
