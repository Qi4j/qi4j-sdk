<h1>Step 2 - Qi4j "Making a booking."</h1>

<p>
    Location: Page 17, "Knowledge-Rich Design.
</p>

<h2>Results from Step1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>For the Cargo and Voyage interfaces, we have introduced the <i>Property&lt;Double&gt;</i>.
        <i>Property</i> is an explicitly supported type in Qi4j, which makes life a lot easier
        for everyone involved.
    </li>
    <li>The SequenceGenerator has changed the name to "HasSequence", since it doesn't handle the
        generation of new numbers. It is given <i>Property&lt;Integer&gt;</i> to hold the last
        sequence number, but it doesn't handle the <i>next()</i> equivalent from Evans' code.
    </li>
    <li>
        The increment of the sequence number is instead handled in the SequencingConcern. One
        advantage is that the number will only be incremented if the policies are met, as we
        will place this concern at the top of the call chain.
    </li>
    <li>
        Overbooking is a concern (according to Mr Evans in this part of the book) for the
        <i>makeBooking()</i> method. So, we create an <i>OverbookingConcern</i>, that implements
        the ShippingService. See below for more details.
    </li>
    <li>
        The ShippingService remains the same. But notice that there is <b>No Implementation!</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        We introduce a new interface, ShippingServiceComposite. This interface binds together the
        parts to form the Composite. It <b>extends</b> the <i>ShippingService</i> and the
        <i>Composite</i> and has annotations about how it should be wire together.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>The ShippingServiceComposite</h3>

<p>
    The <i>ShippingServiceComposite</i> declares which concerns should be used, and the order is significant. The
    <i>SequencingConcern</i> is placed first, that means it will be invoked before the <i>OverbookingConcern</i>,
    but it performs its own work <b>after</b> the call to the <i>next.makeBooking()</i> method.
</p>

<h3>The OverbookingConcern</h3>

<p>
    It extends <i>ConcernOf</i> to show which MixinType it is chained into.
</p>
