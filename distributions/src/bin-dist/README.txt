Welcome to the world of Qi4j
   - Composite Oriented Programming on the Java platform.


This Qi4j Binary Distribution contains everything you need to
create Qi4j applications.


Qi4j (then Qi4j) started in 2007, and is still in heavy development
at the Apache Software Foundation. We would like
developers around the world to participate in the advancement of this
cool, new and challenging technology. We are especially interested in
people willing to help improve the SDK, samples, tutorials, documentation
and other supporting material.


Licensing
---------
All Qi4j code is licensed subject to the Apache License.

Third-Party Dependencies may be licensed under other terms. The only
required dependencies are SLF4J (MIT Licence) and ASM (BSD Licence)

Finally, Qi4j TestSupport depends on JUnit 4.x and its dependencies, which
is also not included in the SDK itself, as it is present among most Java
developers.


Dependencies not included
-------------------------
The binary distributions contains Qi4j artifacts only to keep the download
size small. Each Qi4j artifact comes with a file prefixed ..-runtime-deps.txt
that contains the list of its dependencies. Moreover, at the binary
distribution's root, you'll find both Maven (go-offline.pom) and Gradle
(go-offline.gradle) build files whoses sole purpose is to easily download all
needed dependencies jars. Instructions are given into theses files.
