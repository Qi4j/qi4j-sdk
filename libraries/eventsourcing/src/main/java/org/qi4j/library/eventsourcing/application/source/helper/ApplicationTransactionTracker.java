/**
 * Helper that enables a service to easily track transactions. Upon startup
 * the tracker will get all the transactions from the store since the last
 * check, and delegate them to the given Output. It will also register itself
 * with the store so that it can get continuous updates.
 * <p/>
 * Then, as transactions come in from the store, they will be processed in real-time.
 * If a transaction is successfully handled the configuration of the service, which must
 * extend DomainEventTrackerConfiguration, will update the marker for the last successfully handled transaction.
