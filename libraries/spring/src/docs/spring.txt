== Using Spring Framework in Qi4j ==
Qi4j supports that Spring Application Context is imported into the Qi4j runtime, and the declared Spring
beans will be available as Qi4j services. The most important things to remember are;

    1. Only Spring Singletons are currently supported.
    2. One ApplicationContext per Qi4j Module.
    3. The Qi4j service will be given the same name as the Spring Bean name.
    4. Qi4j Configuration is not reacbable from the Spring bean (kind of obvious).

== Using Qi4j in Spring Framework ==
It is also possible to run a Qi4j Application as a Spring Bean and export its Services to Spring.

Steps to export Qi4j service:

    1. Create spring BeanFactory service of Qi4j services to export.
    2. Create a class that extends Qi4jApplicationBootstrap.
    3. Sets the layer and module that register BeanFactory service.
    4. Assemble Qi4j application by implementing #assemble method.
    5. Sets the identity of bean factory service. This identity is the spring bean name.
    6. Declare Qi4j bootstrap in spring xml application context.

To bootstrap the Qi4j runtime in Spring, you should have a bootstrap bean that extends the
+bootstrap.spring.library.org.qi4j.Qi4jApplicationBootstrap+ and implement the
+org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware+.

A new bean will appear in the application context, called +"qi4jApplication"+ which is only
intended for internal use of this library.

Example application context;
