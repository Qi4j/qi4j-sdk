 * Service for accessing application-specific directories.

 * <p>
 * These will default to the platform settings, but can be overridden manually, either one-by-one or as a whole.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can override defaults by adding org.qi4j.library.fileconfig.FileConfiguration_OS.properties files to your
 * classpath where OS is one of win, mac or unix.
 * <br/>
 * You can also override all properties definitions at assembly time by setting a FileConfigurationOverride object
 * as meta info of this service.

 * Services will most likely want to create their own subdirectories in the directories accessed
 * from here.
