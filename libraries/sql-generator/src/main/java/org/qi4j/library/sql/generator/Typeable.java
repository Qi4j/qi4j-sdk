/**
 * <p>
 * The {@link Object#getClass()} method returns the actual class of the object. Sometimes, that is not what is wanted;
 * instead it would be good to know which API interface the object implements. Let's say we have a API interface
 * hierarchy, and we know that each object implements only one specific interface (it may implement more, but all others
 * must be then super-interface of the actual implemented one). Then we have a mapping from types of interfaces to some
 * other things, like algorithms or some other functionality. We can not use {@link Map#get(Object)} or
 * {@link Map#containsKey(Object)} methods for the result of {@link Object#getClass()}, since we would much rather use
 * API interfaces than actual implementing classes as keys. And because of that, each time, we need to iterate through
 * whole map, and check for each key that whether the specified object is instance of this key. In other words, quite
 * inefficient.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is when this interface comes to aid. It provides a method returning an API interface/class, which is implemented
 * by the implementation. Then one can use the {@link Map#get(Object)} and {@link Map#containsKey(Object)} methods in
 * order to retrieve the object associated with specific API interface, without the need to iterate through whole map.
