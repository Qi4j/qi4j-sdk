OSGi Library allows you to import OSGi services as Qi4j Services and to export Qi4j Services as OSGi Services both
leveraging the Qi4j Availability and OSGi FallbackStrategy mechanisms.

== Export Qi4j services to an OSGi Bundle ==

[snippet,java]

source=libraries/osgi/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/osgi/DocumentationSupport.java
tag=export

== Import OSGi services in a Qi4j Module ==

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/osgi/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/osgi/DocumentationSupport.java
tag=import

The fallback strategy is invoked when the OSGi service is not available and a method call is invoked.
