[[groovy, Scripting with Groovy]]
== Groovy ==

The Groovy Scripting Library is a Generic mixin that implements interfaces by delegating to Groovy code from classpath resources.

But before looking at how to use the Scripting library we'll see that *you don't need Scripting library at all if you
simply need to use Groovy classes as Fragments*. Groovy is a fully Java compatible language and can be used directly,
similarly to Scala.

Then we'll see how to use Groovy class scripts and method scripts.

All examples below are based on this type:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/scripting/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/scripting/HelloSpeaker.java
tag=speaker
----

== Using compiled Groovy classes ==

To directly use compiled Groovy classes as Fragments you don't need this library at all.

Having this Groovy class compiled ;

.HelloSpeakerMixin.groovy
[snippet,groovy]
----
source=libraries/scripting/src/test/groovy/org/qi4j/library/scripting/HelloSpeakerMixin.groovy
tag=direct
----

assemble it directly:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/scripting/src/test/groovy/org/qi4j/library/scripting/HelloSpeakerTest.java
tag=direct
----

== Using Groovy function scripts ==

Declare a Groovy function in a resource file located in the same package as the implemented type with the name +Qi4j<type>.groovy+:

.HelloSpeaker.groovy
[snippet,groovy]
----
source=libraries/scripting/src/test/resources/org/qi4j/library/scripting/QiHelloSpeaker.groovy
tag=script
----

Then assemble it with the normal +ScriptMixin+:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/scripting/src/test/groovy/org/qi4j/library/scripting/HelloSpeakerTest.java
tag=script
----
