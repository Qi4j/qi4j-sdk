The JMX library provides a service that exposes a Qi4j application in
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/docs-jsp-135989.html[JMX]
automatically, giving you an opportunity to inspect the application much as
you would with the <<tools-envisage>> tool.

include::../../build/docs/buildinfo/artifact.txt[]

Services configuration is editable through their corresponding JMX beans.
You can also restart your services so the new configuration is picked up.
