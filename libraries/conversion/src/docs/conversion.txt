The Conversion Library provides support for converting composite types.

== Entities to Values ==

To convert Entities to Values, use the EntityToValueService. It is easily assembled:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/conversion/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/conversion/values/EntityToValueTest.java
tag=assembly
----

Let's say we have an interface defining state:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/conversion/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/conversion/values/EntityToValueTest.java
tag=state
----

An EntityComposite using the state as a Private Mixin:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/conversion/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/conversion/values/EntityToValueTest.java
tag=entity
----

And a ValueComposite extending this very same state;

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/conversion/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/conversion/values/EntityToValueTest.java
tag=value
----

Here is how to convert an EntityComposite to a ValueComposite:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/conversion/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/conversion/values/EntityToValueTest.java
tag=conversion
----

Associations are converted to Identity strings.

If your Entities and Values cannot use the same state type, you can annotate the Value that is the target of the
conversion with the `@Unqualified` annotation. Then, the lookup of the Value Property will be performed using the
*unqualified* name only, and not via the default of the full qualified name. In other words, this means that the
Property may be declared in the different interfaces and still be matched.

Here is an example:

tag=unqualified
