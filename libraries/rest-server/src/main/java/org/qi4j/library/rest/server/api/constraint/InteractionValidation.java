/**
 * Interface that resources can implement to achieve custom validation
 * of whether an interaction is valid or not. If the logic only applies for one
 * method it is usually better to use this instead of creating a new annotation for it.
 * <p/>
 * This is triggered by annotating the method that should be validated like so:
 * <pre><code>
 *
 * &#64;RequiresValid("xyz") public void xyz()
 * {...}
 * <p/>
 * </code></pre>
 * This causes isValid("xyz") to be called. The isValid()
 * method can use the name to determine which set of logic is to be applied. Typically the provided
 * string will correspond to the name of the interaction, but this is not strictly necessary. It is
 * possible to combine several annotations on one method, if desired:
 * <pre><code>
 *
 * &#64;RequiresValid("allowed") &#64;RequiresValid("officehours")
 * public void xyz()
 * {...}
 * </code></pre>
 * <p/>
 * The validation occurs both when a Resource is computed for the resource as a whole, and when an actual
 * invocation of an interaction is made.
