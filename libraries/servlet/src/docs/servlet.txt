This library provide the necessary boilerplate code to bootstrap a Qi4j Application in a Servlet container plus some
facilities. It aims at a very simple need and is provided as an example integration.

If instead you want to run a servlet container inside a Qi4j Application, see <<library-http>>.

== Application Bootstrap ==

Extends `AbstractQi4jServletBootstrap` to easily bind a Qi4j `Application` activation/passivation to your webapp
lifecycle.

Use `Qi4jServletSupport#application(javax.servlet.ServletContext)` to get a handle on the `Application` from the
`ServletContext`.

Here is an example ServletContextListener:

----
source=libraries/servlet/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/servlet/ServletTest.java
tag=bootstrap
----


== Facilities ==

`Qi4jServlet` and `Qi4jFilter` respectively provide base class for easy access to the `Application` from the
`ServletContext`.

Here is a sample servlet that simply output the assembled Application name:

source=libraries/servlet/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/servlet/ServletTest.java
tag=usage

== Logging ==

The SLF4J logger used by this library is named "org.qi4j.library.servlet".
