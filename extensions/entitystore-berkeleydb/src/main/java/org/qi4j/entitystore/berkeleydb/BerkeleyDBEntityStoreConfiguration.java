     * A read-only environment has several limitations and is recommended only in special circumstances. Note that
     * there is no performance advantage to opening an environment read-only.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The primary reason for opening an environment read-only is to open a single environment in multiple JVM
     * processes. Only one JVM process at a time may open the environment read-write. See EnvironmentLockedException.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When the environment is open read-only, the following limitations apply.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In the read-only environment no writes may be performed, as expected, and databases must be opened read-only
     * using DatabaseConfig.setReadOnly.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The read-only environment receives a snapshot of the data that is effectively frozen at the time the environment
     * is opened. If the application has the environment open read-write in another JVM process and modifies the
     * environment's databases in any way, the read-only version of the data will not be updated until the read-only
     * JVM process closes and reopens the environment (and by extension all databases in that environment).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the read-only environment is opened while the environment is in use by another JVM process in read-write mode,
     * opening the environment read-only (recovery) is likely to take longer than it does after a clean shutdown. This
     * is due to the fact that the read-write JVM process is writing and checkpoints are occurring that are not
     * coordinated with the read-only JVM process. The effect is similar to opening an environment after a crash.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In a read-only environment, the JE cache will contain information that cannot be evicted because it was
     * reconstructed by recovery and cannot be flushed to disk. This means that the read-only environment may not be
     * suitable for operations that use large amounts of memory, and poor performance may result if this is attempted.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In a read-write environment, the log cleaner will be prohibited from deleting log files for as long as the
     * environment is open read-only in another JVM process. This may cause disk usage to rise, and for this reason
     * it is not recommended that an environment is kept open read-only in this manner for long periods.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For these reasons, it is recommended that a read-only environment be used only for short periods and for
     * operations that are not performance critical or memory intensive. With few exceptions, all application functions
     * that require access to a JE environment should be built into a single application so that they can be performed
     * in the JVM process where the environment is open read-write.
     * </p>

     * In most applications, opening an environment read-only can and should be avoided.

     * because it overflows. Eviction occurs according to an LRU algorithm and takes into account the user- specified
     * CacheMode. When the off-heap cache overflows, eviction occurs there also according to the same algorithm.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The main cache is in the Java heap and consists primarily of the Java objects making up the in-memory Btree
     * data structure. Btree objects are not serialized the main cache, so no object materialization is needed to
     * access the Btree there. Access to records in the main cache is therefore very fast, but the main cache has
     * drawbacks as well:
     * </p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>
     * The larger the main cache, the more likely it is to have Java GC performance problems.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * When the Java heap exceeds 32GB, the "compressed OOPs" setting no longer applies and less data will fit in the
     * same amount of memory. For these reasons, JE applications often configure a heap of 32GB or less, and a main
     * cache that is significantly less than 32GB, leaving any additional machine memory for use by the file system
     * cache.
     * </li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * The use of the file system cache has performance benefits, but also has its own drawbacks:
     * </p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>
     * There is a significant redundancy between the main cache and the file system cache because all data and Btree
     * information that is logged (written) by JE appears in the file system and may also appear in the main cache.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * It is not possible for dirty Btree information to be placed in the file system cache without logging it, this
     * logging may be otherwise unnecessary, and the logging creates additional work for the JE cleaner; in other
     * words, the size of the main cache alone determines the maximum size of the in-memory "dirty set".
     * </li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * The off-heap cache is stored outside the Java heap using a native platform memory allocator. The current
     * implementation relies on internals that are specific to the Oracle and IBM JDKs; however, a memory allocator
     * interface that can be implemented for other situations is being considered for a future release. Records and
     * Btree objects are serialized when they are placed in the off-heap cache, and they must be materialized when
     * they are moved back to the main cache in order to access them. This serialization and materialization adds
     * some CPU overhead and thread contention, as compared to accessing data directly in the main cache. The off-heap
     * cache can contain dirty Btree information, so it can be used to increase the maximum size of the in-memory
     * "dirty set".
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * NOTE: If an off-heap cache is configured but cannot be used because that native allocator is not available in
     * the JDK that is used, an IllegalStateException will be thrown by the Environment or
     * com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicatedEnvironment constructor. In the current release, this means that the
     * sun.misc.Unsafe class must contain the allocateMemory method and related methods, as defined in the Oracle JDK.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When configuring an off-heap cache you can think of the performance trade-offs in two ways. First, if the
     * off-heap cache is considered to be a replacement for the file system cache, the serialization and
     * materialization overhead is not increased. In this case, the use of the off-heap cache is clearly beneficial,
     * and using the off-heap cache "instead of" the file system cache is normally recommended. Second, the off-heap
     * cache can be used along with a main cache that is reduced in size in order to compensate for Java GC problems.
     * In this case, the trade-off is between the additional serialization, materialization and contention overheads
     * of the off-heap cache, as compared to the Java GC overhead.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When dividing up available memory for the JVM heap, the off-heap cache, and for other uses, please be aware
     * that the file system cache and the off-heap cache are different in one important respect. The file system cache
     * automatically shrinks when memory is needed by the OS or other processes, while the off-heap cache does not.
     * Therefore, it is best to be conservative about leaving memory free for other uses, and it is not a good idea to
     * size the off-heap cache such that all machine memory will be allocated. If off-heap allocations or other
     * allocations fail because there is no available memory, the process is likely to die without any exception
     * being thrown. In one test on Linux, for example, the process was killed abruptly by the OS and the only
     * indication of the problem was the following shown by dmesg.
     * </p>

     * WARNING: Although this configuration property is mutable, it cannot be changed from zero to non-zero, or
     * non-zero to zero. In other words, the size of the off-heap cache can be changed after initially configuring
     * a non-zero size, but the off-heap cache cannot be turned on and off dynamically. An attempt to do so will
