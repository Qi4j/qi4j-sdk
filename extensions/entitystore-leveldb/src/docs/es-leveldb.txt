EntityStore service backed by a https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/[LevelDB] embedded database.

LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to
string values.

By default use the native implementation through JNI bindings and fallback to the pure Java implementation if not
available on the current platform. Used implementation can be forced in the configuration.

The LevelDB EntityStore relies on the <<library-fileconfig>> to decide where it stores its database.
