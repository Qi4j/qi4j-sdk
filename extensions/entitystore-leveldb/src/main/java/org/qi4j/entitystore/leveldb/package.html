            keys to string values.

        <p>
            By default use the native implementation through JNI bindings and fallback to the pure java implementation
            if not available on the current platform. Used implementation can be forced using the
            {@link org.qi4j.entitystore.leveldb.LevelDBEntityStoreConfiguration#flavour()} property.
