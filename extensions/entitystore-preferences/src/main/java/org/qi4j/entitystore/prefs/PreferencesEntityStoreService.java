/**
 * EntityStore backed by Preferences API.
 * <p/>
 * A root node is created in the System preferences, whose name
 * is the same as the Application name (default:"Application").
 * <p/>
 * Each entity is stored under its identity name.
 * <p/>
 * Property types are converted to native Preferences API types
 * as much as possible. All others will be serialized to a string using JSON.
 * <p/>
 * ManyAssociations are stored as multi-line strings (one identity
 * per line), and Associations are stored as the identity
 * of the referenced Entity.
 * <p/>
 * The main use of the EntityStore is for storage of ConfigurationComposites for ServiceComposites.
