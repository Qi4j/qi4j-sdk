EntityStore cache backed by a Memcache server like http://memcached.org/[Memcached].

Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data.
By default, entities serialized state must not exceed 1MB.

Other implementations such as https://www.memcachier.com/[MemCachier] have different peculiarities,
see their documentation.

Not all EntityStore implementations use the Cache extension, so check the implementation details of the
EntityStore whether the cache extension can bring any benefits or not.


== Assembly ==

Assembly is done using the +MemcacheAssembler+:

source=extensions/cache-memcache/src/test/java/org/qi4j/cache/memcache/MemcacheCachePoolTest.java
tag=assembly
----


== Configuration ==

Here are the configuration properties for the Memcache EntityStore Cache:

As you can see both ASCII and binary flavours of the Memcache protocol are supported as well as SASL authentication.
