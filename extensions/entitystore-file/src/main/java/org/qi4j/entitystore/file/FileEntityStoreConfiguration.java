     * Many operating systems run into performance problems when the number of files in a directory grows. If
     * you expect a large number of entities in the file entity store, it is wise to set the number of slices
     * (default is 1) to an approximation of the square root of number of expected entities.

     * <p>
     * For instance, if you estimate that you will have 1 million entities in the file entity store, you should
     * set the slices to 1000.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * There is an limit of minimum 1 slice and maximum 10,000 slices, and if more slices than that is needed, you
     * are probably pushing this entitystore beyond its capabilities.
     * </p>
     * <p>

     * find the entities anymore.
