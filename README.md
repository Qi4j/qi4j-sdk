## What is Qi4j

The short answer is that **Qi4j** is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented Programming for
domain centric application development. This includes evolved concepts from
[Aspect Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming),
[Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
and [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).

**Composite Oriented Programming** allows developers to work with _fragments_, smaller than classes, and _compose_
fragments into larger _composites_ which acts like the regular objects. Qi4j also tackles the enforcement
of _application_ composition, i.e. composites are declared in _modules_, modules are contained in _layers_ and access
between layers are controlled/enforced.

**Qi4j (Java Edition)**, first Qi4j sub-project, is an implementation of Composite Oriented
Programming, using the standard Java platform, without the use of any pre-processors or new language elements.
Everything you know from Java still applies and you can leverage both your experience and toolkits to become more
productive with Composite Oriented Programming today.

The Qi4j community welcomes any effort exploring Composite Oriented Programming for domain centric
application development using any technology.
