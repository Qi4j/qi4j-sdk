[[core-api-structure,Structure]]
= Structure =
Qi4j promotes a conventional view of application structure, that computer science has been using for decades.

The definition is as follows;

    * One Application per Qi4j runtime instance.
    * One or more Layers per Application.
    * Zero, one or more Modules per Layer.
    * Zero, one or more Assemblies per Module.

The principle of this Structure is to assist the programmer to create well modularized applications, that are easily
extended and maintained. Qi4j will restrict access between Modules, so that code can only reach Composites and Objects
in Modules (including itself) of the same or lower Layers.

Each Layer has to be declared which lower Layer(s) it uses, and it is not allowed that a lower Layer uses a higher
Layer, i.e. cyclic references.
