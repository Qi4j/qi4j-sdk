[[core-api-module,Module]]
= Module =
Modules are logical compartments to assist developers in creating and maintaining well modularized code. A Module only
belongs to a single Layer, but many Modules can exist in the same Layer. Composite access is limited to;

    * Composites within the same Module, with Visibility set to Visibility.module (default).
    * Composites from Modules in the same Layer, with Visibility set to Visibility.layer
    * Composites from Modules in Layers below, with Visibility set to Visibility.application

Modules contains a lot of the Qi4j infrastructure, which are the enforcers of these wise modularization principles.

It is not possible to modify the Modules, their resolution nor binding in any way after the application starts.
