The Qi4j Core API is main API that Qi4j developers interact with. In fact, if you need to use classes/interfaces
in the Qi4j Core SPI or Qi4j Core Runtime, then please contact the Qi4j Community and explain your use-case.

The Core API is strictly layered, with no _spaghetti_ cross packages. The package list is fairly long, and
we will look at each one in detail further down.
