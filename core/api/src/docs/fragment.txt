[[core-api-fragment,Fragment]]
== Fragment ==

Composites should be perceived as single units, although they consist of many Java classes and instances. Some of
those Java instances are not even belonging to a particular instance in runtime, but such details can and should
be ignored by the developer. Developers should think of the Composite as a single concept, and not be concerned
about its internal structure.

The Composite is composed by declaring the parts it forms in the Composite Type interface declaration. Technically
speaking, Composite Type is the only Fragment that is required to exist. The other Fragments are optional.

There are 4 types of Fragments in Qi4j;

    * <<core-api-mixin>> - The state carrying part of a Composite.
    * <<core-api-constraint>> - Rules for in and out arguments, typically used for validation.
    * <<core-api-concern>> - Interceptor of method calls. General purpose use, often for cross-cutting behaviors.
    * <<core-api-sideeffect>> - Executed after the method call has been completed, and unable to influence the outcome of the method call.

There are one very important thing to know about Fragments;

*ONLY Mixins can maintain inter-method state.*

That means that Concerns, Constraints and Side Effects can not assume that Java fields between method invocations
are preserved. These Fragments must rely on either Mixins or external services for additional state.
