[[core-api-service-configuration,Service Configuration]]
= Service Configuration =
Configuration in Qi4j is for Qi4j <<core-api-service>> only. The Configuration is stored in a visible Entity
Store and is therefor runtime modifiable and not static in properties or XML files as in most other dependency
injection frameworks.

The Configuration system itself will handle all the details with interfacing with reading and writing the configuration.
The normal UnitOfWork management is used, but handled internally by the configuration system.

In Qi4j, Configuration are strongly typed and refactoring-friendly. Configuration is read from the entity store, but if
it can not be found, then it will try to bootstrap it from a properties file, with the same name as the
ServiceDescriptor.identifiedBy(), which is set during <<core-bootstrap-assembly>> and defaults to the fully qualified
classname of the <<core-api-service>> type.

== Defining a Configuration Type ==
The Configuration type is simply listing the properties that are available. The standard rules on @UseDefaults and
@Optional applies.
Example;

[snippet,java]
--------------
source=core/api/src/test/java/org/qi4j/api/configuration/MailServiceConfiguration.java
tag=configuration
--------------

== Using a Configuration Type ==
It is important to remember that Configuration is not static values that are set prior to application start-up and
therefor applications should not cache the values retrieved forever, but consciously know when the configuration should
be re-read.

Configuration is injected via the @This injection scope. One reasonable strategy is to read the configuration on service
activation, so by deactivating/reactivating a service, the user have a well-defined behavior to know how configuration
changes take effect. Example;

[snippet,java]
--------------
source=core/api/src/test/java/org/qi4j/api/configuration/MailService.java
tag=read
--------------

== Modifying Configuration ==
Configuration is modifiable, and after the modifications have been made, the save() method on the Configuration type
must be called. Example;

source=core/api/src/test/java/org/qi4j/api/configuration/MailService.java
tag=write
