= Composite Types Lookup =

Composite Types Lookup can occurs when you explicitely lookup for a Composite by Type
(ex. ServiceFinder.findService(..) methods), when you ask for an injection or when you create a new composite instance.

All theses type lookup start from a Module, are lazy, cached and obey the Qi4j Visibility rules. Type Lookup works
equally accross Composite Types with some subtle differences when it comes to Services and Entities.


== Object, Transient and Value Types Lookup ==

When creating or injecting Objects, Transients or Values the Type Lookup does the following:

First, if Object/Transient/Value Models exactly match the given type, the closest one (Visibility then Assembly order)
is returned. Multiple *exact* matches with the same Visibility are *forbidden* and result in an
AmbiguousTypeException.

Second, if Object/Transient/Value Models match a type assignable to the given type, the closest one (Visibility then
Assembly order) is returned. Multiple *assignable* matches with the same Visibility are *forbidden* and result in an
AmbiguousTypeException.


== Entity Types Lookup ==

Entity Types Lookup is splitted in two use cases famillies: Creational usecases and Non-Creational usecases.

*Creational Entity Types Lookup*

This Type Lookup takes place when creating new Entity instances from a UnitOfWork and behave exactly like
Object/Transient/Value Types Lookups.

*Non-Creational Entity Types Lookup*

This Type Lookup takes place when fetching Entities from an EntityStore or writing queries using the Query API. The Type
Lookup is different here to allow polymorphic use of Entities and Queries.

First difference is that this Type Lookup returns an ordered collection instead of a single match.

Returned collection contains, in order, Entity Models that:

- exactly match the given type, in Visibility then Assembly order ;
- match a type assignable to the given type, in Visibility then Assembly order.

Multiple *exact* matches with the same Visibility are *forbidden* and result in an AmbiguousTypeException.

Multiple *assignable* matches are *allowed* to enable polymorphic fetches and queries.


== Service Types Lookup ==

Service Types Lookup works as follow:

Returned collection contains, in order, ServiceReferences that:

- exactly match the given type, in Visibility then Assembly order ;
- match a type assignable to the given type, in Visibility then Assembly order.

Multiple *exact* matches with the same Visibility are *allowed* to enable polymorphic lookup/injection.

Multiple *assignable* matches with the same Visibility are *allowed* for the very same reason.
