/**
 * All operations on entities goes through an UnitOfWork.
 * <p>
 * A UnitOfWork allows you to access
 * Entities and work with them. All modifications to Entities are recorded by the UnitOfWork,
 * and at the end they may be sent to the underlying EntityStore by calling complete(). If the
 * UoW was read-only you may instead simply discard() it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A UoW differs from a traditional Transaction in the sense that it is not tied at all to the underlying
 * storage resource. Because of this there is no timeout on a UoW. It can be very short or very long.
 * Another difference is that if a call to complete() fails, and the cause is validation errors in the
 * Entities of the UoW, then these can be corrected and the UoW retried. By contrast, when a Transaction
 * commit fails, then the whole transaction has to be done from the beginning again.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A UoW can be associated with a Usecase. A Usecase describes the metainformation about the process
 * to be performed by the UoW.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a code block that uses a UoW throws an exception you need to ensure that this is handled properly,
 * and that the UoW is closed before returning. Because discard() is a no-op if the UoW is closed, we therefore
 * recommend the following template to be used:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *     UnitOfWork uow = module.newUnitOfWork();
 *     try
 *     {
 *         ...
 *         uow.complete();
 *     }
 *     finally
 *     {
 *         uow.discard();
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This ensures that in the happy case the UoW is completed, and if any exception is thrown the UoW is discarded. After
 * the UoW has completed the discard() method doesn't do anything, and so has no effect. You can choose to either add
 * catch blocks for any exceptions, including exceptions from complete(), or skip them.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since 2.1 you can leverage Java 7 Automatic Resource Management (ie. Try With Resources) and use the following
 * template instead:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *     try( UnitOfWork uow = module.newUnitOfWork() )
 *     {
 *         ...
 *         uow.complete();
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * It has the very same effect as the template above but is shorter.</p>
