/**
 * This annotation is used in composites to declare mixin implementation classes.
 * <p>
 * Mixins tells the runtime which implementation class of a Mixin should be
 * used. The &#64;Mixins annotation can occur at any level in the composite hierarchy
 * and the runtime will match each found Mixin implementation against a Mixins annotation.
 * All mixin interfaces must have a Mixin implementation in the composite hierarchy or
 * a runtime exception will occur.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example;
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 *
 * &#64;Mixins( MyBeerOrder.class )
 * public interface BeerOrderComposite extends BeerOrder, Composite
 * {
 * }
 *
 * public class MyBeerOrder
 * implements BeerOrder
 * {
 * :
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * Many implementations can be listed,
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 * &#64;Mixins( { MyBeerOrder.class, DescriptionImpl.class } )
 * public interface BeerOrderComposite extends BeerOrder, Description, Composite
 * {
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * If the Mixins is a class that implements InvocationHandler, it will be
 * used for all mixins. To avoid that an invocation handler based implementation
 * not service all mixin, use the AppliesTo annotation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is valid to have multiple Mixins for a mixin. The first one found
 * will be used. The search order is in the order they are written in the Mixins
 * annotation left-to-right, and depth-first recursive search of the super-interfaces again
 * left-to-right.
 * </p>
