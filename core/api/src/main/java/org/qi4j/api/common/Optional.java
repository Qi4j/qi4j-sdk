/**
 * Annotation to denote that something is optional.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * If applied to a method parameter, then the value is allowed to be null. Default
 * is that method parameters have to be non-null.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If applied to a Property declaration, then the value may be null after construction of
 * the instance, or may be set to null at a later time.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If applied to an injected member field, it is allowed tha none get injected. For instance, an <code>&#64;Optional
 * &#64;Service</code> would allow a service to not have been declared and the field will be null.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Optionality is not the default in Qi4j, and if injections, property values and parameters in methods are not
 * non-null, the Qi4j runtime will throw an {@link org.qi4j.api.constraint.ConstraintViolationException}, indicating
 * which field/property/parameter in which composite and mixin the problem has been detected.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example;
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 * &#64;Optional &#64;Service
 * MyService service;   // If no MyService instance is declared and visible to this service injection point
 *                      // the 'service' field will be null.
 *
 * &#64;Service
 * YourService other;   // If no YourService instance is declared and visible to this service injection point
 *                      // the Qi4j runtime will throw a ConstraintViolationException.
 *
 * </code></pre>
