/**
 * Visibility is a core concept in the Qi4j structure system. It defines the locale of composites and objects, i.e.
 * how far they can be 'seen' and therefor be used.
 * <p>
 * When a Composite or Object is declared in the assembly phase, and no visibility is set, only other
 * composites/objects within the same module can use that declaration. For a declared composite/object to be usable
 * from other modules a higher visibility must be set, either that the Composite/Object can be used by others within
 * the same Layer, or even to be used by those in the layer above.
