/**
 * Implementations of this interface can be specified in the &#64;AppliesTo.
 * <p>
 * AppliesTo filters are one of the driving technologies in Qi4j. They allow you to apply fragments (Mixins,
 * Concerns, SideEffects), often generic ones, depending on the context that they are evaluated under. This
 * mechanism is heavily used internally in Qi4j to achieve many other features.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The starting point is the basic use of AppliesToFilter, where the &#64;AppliesTo annotation is given an
 * AppliesToFilter implementation as an argument, for instance at a Mixin implementation;
 * <pre></code>
 * &#64;AppliesTo( MyAppliesToFilter.class )
 * public class SomeMixin
 *     implements InvocationHandler
 * {
 *
 * }
 *
 * public class MyAppliesToFilter
 *     implements AppliesToFilter
 * {
 *     public boolean appliesTo( Method method, Class&lt;?&gt; mixin, Class&lt;?&gt; compositeType, Class&lt;?&gt; fragmentClass )
 *     {
 *         return method.getName().startsWith( "my" );
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * In the case above, the generic mixin will only be applied to the methods that that is defined by the
 * AppliesToFilter. This is the primary way to define limits on the application of generic fragments, since
 * especially mixins are rarely applied to all methods.
 * </p>
