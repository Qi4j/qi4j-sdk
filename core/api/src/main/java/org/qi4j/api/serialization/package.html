<h2>Serialization API.</h2>
<p>
    {@link serialization.api.org.qi4j.Serialization}
    extends {@link serialization.api.org.qi4j.Serializer}
    and {@link serialization.api.org.qi4j.Deserializer}.
    <br/>
    {@link serialization.api.org.qi4j.SerializationException}
    is thrown when something goes wrong.
</p>
<p>
    Serialization implementations should be tagged with
    {@link org.qi4j.api.serialization.Serialization.Format}
    at assembly time so that consumers can specify which format they need:
</p>
<pre><code>@Service @Tagged( Serialization.Format.JSON ) Serialization serialization;</code></pre>
<p>
    {@literal Serializer}s and {@literal Deserializer}s provides methods and functions to (de)serialize objects
    and set of objects.
</p>
<p>
    Serialized representations might be textual (e.g. {@literal JSON} and {@literal XML}) or binary.
    Implementations are free to use any codec to encode/decode from/to text and bytes but it must be bi-directional.
</p>
<p>
    The serialization behavior can be influenced using {@link org.qi4j.api.serialization.Serializer.Options}.
