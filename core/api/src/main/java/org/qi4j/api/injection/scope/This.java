 * Annotation to denote the injection of a reference to the same Composite
 * as the fragment is a part of.
 * <p/>
 * If the Composite type does not implement the type of the field or parameter
 * then it will be referencing a private mixin.
 * <p/>
 * Calls to the reference will have the same semantics as calls to the Composite itself.
 * Specifically the same set of Modifiers will be used.
