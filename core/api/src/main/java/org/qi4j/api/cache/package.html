        <h2>Cache API.</h2>
        <p>
            The Cache API/SPI is an extension point for Entity Store caching.
        </p>
        <p>
            The API part is only to allow caching options to be passed to the underlying extension in a uniform and
            standard way. CacheOptions are to be passed as meta info on the optional Cache extension that is specified
            during assembly phase. Example;
        </p>
<pre><code>
public void assemble( ModuleAssembly module )
{
    CacheOptions options = new CacheOptions( true, true, false );
    module.addServices( EhCacheService.class ).setMetaInfo( options );
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
            Not all EntityStore implementations use the Cache extension, so check the implementation details of the
            EntityStore whether the cache extension can bring any benefits or not.
        </p>
