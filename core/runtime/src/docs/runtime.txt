First of all, your code should never, ever, have a dependency on Core Runtime. If you think you need this, you should
probably contact qi4j-dev forum at Google Groups and see if your usecase can either be solved in a existing way or perhaps
that a new Core SPI Extension is needed.

Let's repeat that; *Never, never, ever depend on Core Runtime*. Make sure that the compile dependency does NOT include
the `org.qi4j.core.runtime` jar.
