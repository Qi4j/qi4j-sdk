[[tools-envisage,Envisage Tool]]
= Envisage =

Envisage is a Swing based visualization tool for the Qi4j Application model.
Visualizations can be printed to PDFs.

include::../../build/docs/buildinfo/artifact.txt[]

It can be handy to run Envisage in development <<def-application-mode, Mode>> while working on assemblies.

== Usage ==

Envisage can be easily used directly and prior your Application activation:

[snippet,java]
----
source=tools/envisage/src/test/java/org/qi4j/envisage/school/EnvisageSchoolSample.java
tag=envisage
----

As you can see, Envisage operates on the ApplicationDescriptor, this means that you
can easily embed it in your own Applications too.

From the sources you can run the `runEnvisageSample` or `runEnvisageSchoolSample` Gradle tasks
to run interactive examples. See <<build-system>> if you need some guidance.
