# Indexing strategy.
# s = subject
# p = predicate
# o = object
# c = context
#
# These are then combined in groups of "one each" such as "spoc" or "pocs".
# Multiple groups can be given, in which case multiple indexs will be
# maintained.
#
# This will heavily influence both indexing as well as query times, and one
# should experiment for optimal performance.
#
#
# @Matches( "([spoc][spoc][spoc][spoc],?)*" )
# Default:
#
# tripleIndexes-

# The location of storing the index.
#
# If the FileConfiguration service is available, then the location is set to
#    fc.dataDirectory() + serviceIdentity
#
# Otherwise, if serviceIdentity is null or empty, the location is set to
#    "./rdf/repositories/qi4j"
#
# Otherwise, if serviceIdentity is a valid value, the location is set to
#    "./rdf/repositories/" + serviceIdentity
#
#
# Defaults: <see above>
# dataDirectory=

# Whether to wait for disk sync.
#
# Defaults: false
# forceSync=
