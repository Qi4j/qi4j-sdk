Branch 4.x
----------

Main goals of Version 4 of Qi4j.

1. Upgrade to Java 17 and later versions. Qi4j has been stuck in Java 8 for too
   long. Need to grab it by the horns.
     - Java 9 Module support and handling
     - Remove deprecated Java Reflection usages, such as isAccessible().
     - Make sure that ASM bytecode generation is still correct where used.
     - Support for Records?
     - Support for interface methods?

2. Messaging SPI. Consuming and Producing messages for systems like Kafka,
   Pulsar, RabbitMQ and others should be pluggable, just like we have done with
   entity stores.

3. Removal of old cruft. There are many parts of Qi4j that is simply
   unmaintainable, and should be removed to avoid confusion. Better to focus
   on what works well and can be supported.
