USE CASE        Inspect Arrived Cargo [subfunction]
===========================================================================
A Delivery Inspector inspects and updates the delivery status of a cargo that
has been unloaded at its final destination according to the route specification.

Since the route specification is the single authority to determine the final
destination of the cargo - regardless of any itinerary - we should be able to
only save the routing/misdirection status for internal reference without
notifying the cargo owner. Could be interesting to hear what a domain expert
thinks of this...

Our _transportation_ obligations have ended here and our last responsibility is to
notify the cargo owner that the cargo has arrived and is ready to be claimed.


Primary actor.. Delivery Inspector
Scope.......... Handling Monitoring System in shipping application
Preconditions.. Cargo has been unloaded from a carrier in final destination.
Trigger........ Delivery Inspector receives request to inspect the delivery status of arrived cargo.


Main Success Scenario
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Delivery Inspector collects known delivery data.
2. Delivery Inspector determines that cargo is routed (for internal reference).
3. Delivery Inspector sets next expected handling event to claim.
4. Delivery Inspector saves cargo delivery snapshot.
5. Delivery Inspector notifies cargo owner of cargo arrival at final destination.


Deviations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2a. Cargo has no itinerary:
    1. Delivery Inspector marks cargo as non-routed.

2b. RouteSpecification is not satisfied by Itinerary:
    1. Delivery Inspector marks cargo as misrouted.
