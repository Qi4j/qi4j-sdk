USE CASE        Inspect Unhandled Cargo [subfunction]
===========================================================================
A Delivery Inspector inspects and updates the delivery status of a cargo that has
not been received in the origin location yet.

Since the route specification is the single authority to determine the origin
of the cargo - regardless of any itinerary - we expect the cargo to be received
in the origin location as the first handling event.
