USE CASE        Inspect Claimed Cargo [subfunction]
===========================================================================
A Delivery Inspector inspects and updates the delivery status of a claimed cargo.

The cargo owner can claim the cargo in any location along the route or even in an
unexpected location if it was misdirected! Whenever it gets picked up it marks the
end of the cargo delivery cycle.

From this point our job is done and we have no reason to determine a next handling
event or notify the cargo owner of the cargo eventually being misdirected or
misrouted (we though calculate it for internal reference).


Primary actor.. Delivery Inspector
Scope.......... Handling Monitoring System in shipping application
Preconditions.. Cargo has been claimed by cargo owner.
Trigger........ Delivery Inspector receives request to inspect the delivery status of claimed cargo.

1. Delivery Inspector collects known delivery data.
2. Delivery Inspector determines that cargo was routed (for internal reference).
3. Delivery Inspector determines that cargo was on track according to itinerary (for internal reference).
4. Delivery Inspector saves cargo delivery snapshot.


Deviations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2a. Cargo has no itinerary:
    1. Delivery Inspector marks cargo as non-routed.

2b. RouteSpecification was not satisfied by Itinerary:
    1. Delivery Inspector marks cargo as misrouted.

3a. Claim location was not the same as itinerary destination:
    1. Delivery Inspector marks cargo as misdirected.
