USE CASE        Inspect Cargo In Customs [subfunction]
===========================================================================
A Delivery Inspector inspects and updates the delivery status of a cargo being
handled in customs.

It seems from the DDD sample code that a cargo can be handled by customs authorities
in any location. So even if this is different from the last known location - or even
not in the itinerary - the cargo will still be on track.

In the DDD sample we can have additional transportation after a customs handling event,
but isn't a claim a more logical expected next step? Can a cargo be handled by customs
authorities and then continue its travel to other locations?!

For now we don't predict any next handling event - a domain expert opinion on this
would be interesting.
