== Qi4j SDK ==
We are working towards distributing a useful SDK for Qi4j development, usable without connectivity. This work has not
been highest on the list and we are generally lagging in the release of the SDK in comparison to the artifact releases.
We strive to change this in the future.

=== Versioning ===
Qi4j versioning tries to stick to;

   * For changes in the 3rd version digit, for instance from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2, only bug fixes have occurred.
   * For changes in the 2nd version digit, for instance from 1.3.1 to 1.4, more features have been added.
   * For changes in the 1st version digit, for instance from 1.3.1 to 2.0, incompatibilities have been introduced.

However, this will only be true for the Qi4j API, i.e. the classes found in org.qi4j.core.api JAR. For SPI and
especially the runtime, we reserve the right of incompatible changes between releases in the second digit.

Qi4j also has dependencies on other systems. We reserve the right that these dependencies may change between releases.
For instance, a change between 1.1 and 1.2 was that CGLib was dropped and replaced by ASM as a new dependency.

=== Releases ===

<<howto-depend-on-qi4j, depend on Qi4j in your build>>.

The Qi4j SDK is split in two downloads: binaries and sources. Both downloads are available in the zip and tar.gz formats.
The source code is also available on https://github.com/qi4j/qi4j-sdk[Github].
