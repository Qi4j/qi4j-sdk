= Participate =
Qi4j is a community based on open development principles. That means we do the work in open, discussions happen on
mailing lists and everyone is free to participate.

== Principles of Participation ==

(not enforced yet)
We borrow a lot of our principles in community building from OPS4J, which also provides us with the infrastructure
needs we have for the time being. OPS4J is unique that it allows everyone to participate and modify the codebase
without being voted into the community, like Apache and other communities. We want the spirit of this, but we are a bit
nervous that Qi4j will be too successful and too many people want to modify the core pieces and some will spoil more
than progress.
We have therefor concluded that we will, at least initially, confine the Qi4j Core to entrusted members of the
community only, whereas everyone is free to participate in the many other sub-projects, such as extensions, libraries
and integration solutions. By the introduction of Git, it is now much easier for people to work on any part of the
system, even if they have no official commit rights and allow people to review the work, then commit it and the right
person gets the credit.

== Core Team ==

The Core team are the Stewards and Guardians of the overall project. They ensure that all pieces of Qi4j are in good
standing and assist in all matters of the project. Only the Core Team will modify the official Qi4j Core repository.

== Platform Team ==

The Platform team are the work horses of the project, and are adding a lot of value to our libraries and extensions.
These two repositories are where the bulk of the valuable code will eventually reside. The Platform Team consists of
people who are showing dedication to the project.

== Community ==

All remaining areas are open to anyone who ask (politely). Send GitHub ID to qi4j-dev@lists.ops4j.org together with an
introduction of yourself.

== Additionally ==

GitHub's community features should not be understated. You are encouraged to clone our repostories, work on your own
features and do pull requests for Core and Platform teams to pick up. It is wise to send a mail to qi4j-dev@ before
issuing a pull request along with an explanation of what the patch is for and the rationale behind it.
