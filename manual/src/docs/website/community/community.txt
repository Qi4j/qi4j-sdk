Qi4j is an open development community effort with an Apache ver 2.0 open source license.

== What does this really mean? ==

First of all, we work together to achieve the visions of Qi4j, based on technical merits alone in an open and friendly
manner, mostly via e-mail to the mailing list. It means that everyone in the community are stake holders in the
resulting codebase, and noone can claim it is mine.

Secondly, all source code, artwork and documentation produced in Qi4j are licensed very liberally under the Apache
License ver 2.0. This allows you to use our efforts in your own projects, whether they are open sourced, commercial or
any other arrangement you like, subject to a few terms like "Must re-distribute a Notice that your product contains
Qi4j" and such. See the License text for exact details, and please consult with IP rights lawyers about this and other
Open Source licenses.

Thirdly, Qi4j invites everyone to participate. There are many ways to participate, not only by writing code. See list
on Participate page.
