= Qi4j SDK 1.2 Released =

The Qi4j community today announced the 3rd installment of the innovative Java
framework, Qi4j. The main new features includes, SQL EntityStore, SQL
Indexing/Querying, Caching SPI and a Service Qualifier API.

Additional to the new features, numerous improvements were made along side with
significant internal changes. Here is a break down of the more important issues;

The Cache SPI is another important new feature. The pluggable Cache SPI means
that it is equally simple to add new caching implementations as it is to add
Entity Store implementations, in fact even easier since the SPI is very simple.
The entity stores implementations that leverages the MapEntityStore layer in
the Qi4j Runtime (which most do), will automatically benefit from the plugged
in Cache.

The support of SQL has been a long-standing requested item, and thanks to new
community blood, we now have the first generation of both EntityStore
implementation as well as using SQL backends for querying and indexing. These
two implementations is a testament that the Qi4j data model is truly flexible.
The current implementation does not, however, support mapping of existing
tables and expect to 'own' the tables it needs. PostgreSQL and MySQL are the
first support RDBMSes, and more are bound to follow in upcoming releases.

SLF4J was introduced as a dependency in Qi4j Core, and slowly starting to add
additional debug and trace statements in the internals of Qi4j Runtime to aid
in troubleshooting.

Qi4j community has also noted a JDK bug, which surface as a
java.lang.ArrayStoreException, but is really a
java.lang.TypeNotPresentException that gets treated incorrectly deep inside
com.sun packages. This release did not manage to work around this, but we will
in the next release.

The bugs fixed are of various nature. Some of the bugs listed in the release
notes are possibly fixed prior to Qi4j 1.1, but not identified correctly. The
two most important bug fixes are QI-247, Incorrect delegation of Object methods
in TransientComposite, and QI-241 regarding the matching algorithm for
@AppliesTo. The latter may seriously affect existing applications to include
fragments when it previously didn't.
