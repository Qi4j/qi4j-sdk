= Qi4j SDK 1.0 has been released! =

Qi4j SDK 1.0 has now been released. After 2 years of hard work, we have finally
made an official release available. It contains all the core features of Qi4j,
such as composites made from fragments like mixins, concerns, side-effects and
constraints, and also the libraries and extensions that are useful for most
application development.

During this weeks JFokus conference in Stockholm, Sweden, the Qi4j community
released Qi4j SDK 1.0. Rickard Ã–berg made two presentations in association with
the conference, focusing on how Qi4j and Composite Oriented Programming makes
working with domain models on the Java platform easier compared to the usual
POJO approach typically used in todays application development.

Qi4j is a significant step forward for the Java platform, with its focus on
Domain Driven Design and support for the

paradigm that is currently being worked on by Trygve Reenskaug as a way to
revive object-orientation.
