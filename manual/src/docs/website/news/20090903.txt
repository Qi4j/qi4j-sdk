= @ JavaZone 2009 - Persistence =

JavaZone 2009 is held as usual in Oslo, Norway, on the 9th and 10th of
September 2009. It is set to be an exciting event, Scandinavias larges Java
Developer's conference, but covers adjacent languages as well, such as Scala,
Groovy and JRuby. Qi4j is represented with a presentation by Niclas Hedhman
about "Qi4j Persistence" (10th Sept, 11:45). The short time available will only
allow for the basics of Qi4j Persistence to be covered, but the audience is
expected to get tantalized and curious about our great framework for rich
domain model development.

Many other great speakers, both local Norwegians as well as International ones,
will be present and all is set for a great conference, again...

Niclas will of course be available most of the conference time for face-to-face
discussions, feedback and questions on Qi4j topics.

See you in Oslo.
