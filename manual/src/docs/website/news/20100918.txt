= @ JavaZone 2010 - ReST/DCI =

Qi4j at JavaZone 2010, Oslo, Norway. Rickard Ã–berg presented
"Implementing a Rest API with DCI and Qi4j" at JavaZone on the 8 Sept 2010.

Implementing a REST API today is important in many cases, both as an
integration point to your application and as a way for clients to access the
application. But there are few frameworks out there that help you fulfil all
the constraints of REST, and therefore only makes your API a REST-wannabe. This
session will look at how you can use Qi4j along with the DCI pattern to
implement a truly RESTful API, that follows all the constraints. We will look
at how DCI maps to the RESTful way of thinking about web API's, and how Qi4j
can help with the actual implementation.
