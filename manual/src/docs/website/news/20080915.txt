= @ JavaZone 2008 - COP/Qi4j =

In the current programming culture we have lost the OOP idea of objects
containing both logic and state, the idea of reuse has largely failed due to
impractical mechanisms, and combining pieces of code into larger structures
using AOP has not quite delivered on its promises. Building large-scale
software also gives us challenges with regard to complexity, enforcing
architectural rules and codebase explosion. What if we could look at what we
have and figure out a new way to address these problems, while promoting the
idea from domain oriented modeling and retaining what works with what we have
now? Composite Oriented Programing is a new way of dealing with these problems,
and this presentation will show how the Qi4j implementation on the Java
platform will enable you to get more done with less work, and in a way that
allows you to avoid the mentioned problems. It will describe the COP
terminology and show examples on how to use Qi4j to implement domain oriented
models.
