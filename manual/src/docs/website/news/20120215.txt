Implementing a REST API today is important in many cases, both as an integration point to your application and as a way
for clients to access the application. But there are few frameworks out there that help you fulfil all the constraints
of REST, and therefore only makes your API a REST-wannabe. The idiom that's often missing is HATEOAS. This session will
