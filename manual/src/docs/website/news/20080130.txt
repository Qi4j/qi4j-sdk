OOP neglects the need of objects to adjust its behavior depending on the
context. "John is a parent and programmer in the city, but a hunter and food in
the jungle.". Same object, different contexts. OOP has also not fulfilled its
promise of re-usability, partly due to such static behavior and partly due to
its inability to deal with fine-granularity of states and behaviors. Composite
Oriented Programming addresses these issues, and Qi4J is an implementation
available to Java programmers today.
