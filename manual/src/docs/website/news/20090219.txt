= DDD support in Qi4j explained =

Domain Driven Design has a special status in Qi4j, and its tactical bits are
embraced in Qi4j itself. These includes Entities, Services and Values. In
Rickard's blog entry http://www.jroller.com/rickard/entry/qi4j_and_state_modeling[Qi4j and state modeling],
he covers these topics in a relatively easy to understand and pedagogic format. A highly recommended read
for people who want to get a quick overview of what Qi4j is really about.
