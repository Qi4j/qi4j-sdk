TIP: Theses tutorials are based on actual code found in the `tutorials/` directory of the
http://qi4j.org/downloads.html[Qi4j SDK sources]. You should start your favorite editor and find the code related to
this tutorial, run it and play with it.

In this section you will find a comprehensive set of tutorials about Composite Oriented Programming using Qi4j.

[[tutorials-intro,Qi4j in 2 hours 42 minutes]]
=== Qi4j in 2 hours 42 minutes ===

This quite long introduction to Qi4j will start by brushing up an overview of the problems Qi4j solve, teach you what
Composite Oriented Programming is and guide you through the process of writing a complete Application around an adapted
Hello World example.

- <<two-minutes-intro>>
- <<ten-minutes-intro>>
- <<thirty-minutes-intro>>
- <<two-hours-intro>>

=== Getting real with Qi4j ===

Throughout this set of tutorials it will be shown how to depend on Qi4j in your build, how to assemble a complete
application, how to create and work with Composites and Services, how to use contextual fragments and leverage
properties.

- <<howto-depend-on-qi4j>>
- <<howto-assemble-application>>
- <<tut-composites>>
- <<tut-services>>
- <<howto-contextual-fragments>>
- <<howto-leverage-properties>>

=== More tutorials ===

In this other set of tutorials it will be shown how to achieve tasks that frequently arise during the development of a
typical application.

- <<howto-create-constraint>>
- <<howto-create-concern>>
- <<howto-create-sideeffect>>
- <<howto-create-entity>>
- <<howto-configure-service>>
- <<howto-use-io>>
