== Overview ==

The Qi4j Core is composed of several artifacts described in this section.

The following figure show the Core artifacts alongside <<libraries,libraries>> and <<extensions,extensions>>, and, in green,
typical applications artifacts. This is not a full code dependency graph but should give you a good overview of how the
pieces fit together. Find out more about each of the Qi4j Core artifacts below.

//*<<core-api,Core API>>*
=== Core API ===

//____
The Qi4j Core API is the primary interface for client application code during the main execution phase, i.e. after the
application has been activated.

//*<<core-bootstrap-assembly,Core Bootstrap>>*
=== Core Bootstrap ===
//____
Qi4j has a distinct bootstrap phase, also known as the _Assembly_ of an application, where the applications structure
is defined programmatically. Once all the layers, modules and all the composite types in each module have been defined
the model is instantiated into an application. This enables the entire _structure_ system in Qi4j, where types "belongs"
to a module and visibility rules define default behaviors, enforcement of architectural integrity and much more.

//*<<core-testsupport,Core Test Support>>*
=== Core Test Support ===
//____
Qi4j comes with classes to help with testing. There is also some mocking support, to allow some of Qi4jâ€™s unique
aspects to be mocked, but since Qi4j is so flexible at a fine-granular level, we have found that mocking is seldom,
if ever, needed.

//*<<core-functional,Core Functional API>>*
=== Core Functional API ===
//____
The Qi4j Core Functional API is a generic package to work with Iterables in a "functional programming language" style.

This package is completely independent of everything else in Qi4j and may be used on its own in any kind of environment
such as Spring or Java EE applications.

//____

//*<<core-io,Core I/O API>>*
=== Core I/O API ===
//____
The Qi4j Core I/O API tries to address the problem around shuffling data around from various I/O inputs and outputs,
possibly with transformations and filtering along the way.

<<core-io,Learn more>>
//____

//*<<core-spi,Core Extension SPI>>*
=== Core Extension SPI ===
//____
The Qi4j Core Runtime has a number of extension points, which we call the _Qi4j Core Extension SPI_. These are defined
interfaces used *only* by the Core Runtime and *never* directly by application code. <<extensions>> are assembled in
applications during the bootstrap phase.

<<core-spi,Learn more>>
//____

//*<<core-spi,Core Runtime>>*
=== Core Runtime ===
//____
Your code should *never*, *ever*, have a dependency on Qi4j Core Runtime. If you think you need this, you should
probably contact qi4j-dev forum at Google Groups and see if your usecase can either be solved in a existing way or
perhaps that a new Core Extension SPI is needed.
