== Overview ==

The Qi4j Libraries are of varying maturity level and we try to maintain a STATUS (dev-status.xml) file indicating
how good the codebase, documentation and unit tests are for each of the libraries. This is highly subjective and
potentially different individuals will judge this differently, but at least it gives a ballpark idea of the situation
for our users.
