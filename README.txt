Welcome to the world of Qi4j
   - Composite Oriented Programming on the Java platform.


This Qi4j SDK contains everything you need to create Qi4j applications.


Qi4j started in 2007, and is still in heavy development. We would like
developers around the world to participate in the advancement of this
cool, new and challenging technology. We are especially interested in
people willing to help improve the SDK, samples, tutorials, documentation
and other supporting material.

Please see http://qi4j.org for more information.


Licensing
---------
All Qi4j code is licensed under an Apache License.

Third-Party Dependencies may be licensed under other terms. The only
required dependencies are SLF4J (MIT Licence), ASM (BSD Licence) and
Joda-Time (Apache Licence).


Dependencies not included
-------------------------
The binary distributions contains Qi4j artifacts only to keep the download
size small. Each Qi4j artifact comes with a file prefixed ..-runtime-deps.txt
that contains the list of its dependencies. Moreover, at the SDK root you'll
find a Metalink file named qi4j-sdk-runtime-deps.metalink that you can use to
download all needed dependencies jars. Metalink files can be downloaded using
curl, aria2 and a lot of other download tools. Support in wget is coming.

Finally, Qi4j TestSupport depends on JUnit 4.x and its dependencies, which
is also not included in the SDK itself, as it is present among most Java
developers.
